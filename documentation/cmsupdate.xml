      <title>What is Akeeba CMS Update?</title>

      <para>Akeeba CMS Update is the better update component for the Joomla!
      CMS. Its one mission is to check for Joomla! updates and let you install
      them in an efficient way, even on the usually problematic shared
      hosting. Unlike the Joomla! Update component distributed with Joomla!,
      Akeeba CMS Update has some unique features:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Improved update
          determination</emphasis>. While Joomla! Update uses the outdated
          JUpdate library, our component uses a new library built from
          scratch, based on our 7+ years of experience in providing live
          update features in our software. The end result is a more robust
          implementation which is far less likely to "get stuck".</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Retroactive bug fixes</emphasis>. One of
          the major problems with Joomla! Update being part of the CMS itself
          is that any bugs discovered in its code will only be fixed in a
          future version of Joomla!. But how do you update to this new version
          of Joomla! when the updater itself won't let you? Akeeba CMS Update
          allows you to update it before updating Joomla!, swiftly overcoming
          this chicken and egg problem.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Backup on update</emphasis>. If you have
          Akeeba Backup installed you can automatically backup your site
          before a new Joomla! version is installed. Even better, you can
          choose which backup profile to use.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Update notification by email</emphasis>.
          If you have several sites it's extremely hard to know which ones
          need to be updated and time consuming to do so – at least without
          paying a premium for a third party, closed source, site monitoring
          service. Akeeba CMS Update will have your site email when there is
          an update available. The link in the email allows for a two-click
          update: one click on the link, another one to verify your intention.
          No login required. It even integrates with Admin Tools to provide an
          smooth auto-login experience. The frequency of the emails is
          configurable.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Integrated notification of all Joomla!
          releases, including the testing (dev) branch</emphasis>. By default,
          Joomla! Update only displays available updates in the current CMS
          version branch. Akeeba CMS Update by default shows you all available
          update options, allowing you to choose which version to install.
          This is of course configurable.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Alternate connectivity to update
          server</emphasis>. Whereas most Joomla! versions require you to have
          the fopen() URL wrappers enabled, Akeeba CMS Update will
          intelligently choose between that or cURL to fetch updates. It all
          happens automatically. All you know is that it just works!</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Hybrid restoration engine</emphasis>.
          The biggest nightmare of CMS users on shared hosting is a situation
          aptly described as "permissions hell": different files and folders
          owned by different system users with wildly different permissions.
          This makes it impossible to update a site either with PHP direct
          file writes or by uploading files via FTP. When everyone else fails,
          our vast experience in backup restoration technology allows us to
          succeed with the Hybrid engine which intelligently uses direct file
          writes or FTP, on a file-by-file (and directory-by-directory)
          basis.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Segmented download for improved
          stability</emphasis>. Certain Joomla! updates are unwieldy in size
          for a large percentage of cheap hosting. The usual outcome is that
          the update download fails with a timeout error and you, the CMS
          user, are left with no option to install the update. Our advanced
          downloader technology allows us to download the update files one
          small chunk at a time, overcoming hosting limits. This is
          transparent to you and all you know is that it just works, every
          single time.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Automatic updates</emphasis>. Forget
          about having to log in to your site to perform the update to the
          next Joomla! version. Using our provided CLI script you can easily
          create a CRON job which automatically updates Joomla! to the latest
          version when it's available. On top of that, it will automatically
          backup your site before update. Even better, you don't have to pay a
          penny to use it – unlike third party, closed source, site monitoring
          services.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Akeeba CMS Update is provided free of charge under the GNU General
      Public License version 3 or, at your option, any later version published
      by the Free Software Foundation. It's truly Free software, in every
      sense of the word.</para>

      <bridgehead>Why did we build this component instead of contribute it to
      Joomla!?</bridgehead>

      <para>Akeeba Ltd and its developers have been involved with Joomla!
      since its first day. We have been publishing our acclaimed Akeeba Backup
      software (and its predecessor, JoomlaPack) since 2006, helping millions
      of sites to have up-to-date backups and move between servers
      effectively. Since 2010 we have also been publishing Admin Tools, a
      collection of security and utilitarian features for the Joomla! CMS. One
      of Admin Tools' features, Joomla! update, has been included in Joomla!
      itself since version 2.5. It's rebranded as "Joomla! Update".</para>

      <para>In the roughly one year and a half between the release of Joomla!
      2.5 and starting work on Akeeba CMS Update we identified several issues
      with Joomla! Update. Sadly, many of them required either the Joomla!
      project to change its distribution policy (i.e. providing updates for
      Joomla! Update before a new Joomla! release is issued) or stepped into
      the territory of the Joomla! libraries themselves. The scope of the
      necessary changes was impossible to muster within a project that follows
      a "design by committee" approach for all code decisions. Moreover, some
      of the most advanced features (like backup on update) could never make
      it into Joomla! itself. This is understandable, the Joomla! project
      <emphasis>usually</emphasis> doesn't promote specific companies'
      products, as would happen with Akeeba Backup in this case.</para>

      <para>Instead of wasting precious months to get few small changes in the
      core, without even getting to an end result we'd feel comfortable with,
      we decided to build our own vastly improved updater and put it out there
      for real people to use it in the real world and prove its worth. Maybe,
      in the future, some of its advanced features will be retrofitted to
      Joomla! Update and the core Joomla! libraries. We intend to keep this
      product around and update it often, based on our clients'
      feedback.</para>

    <section xml:id="requirements">
      <title>Server environment requirements</title>

      <para>In order to work, Akeeba CMS Update requires the following server
      software environment:</para>

          may run on servers with lesser memory limits, but some features may
          not work optimally or at all.</para>

      supported by the Joomla! CMS, including most mobile devices'
      browsers.</para>

        <para>Sometimes <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> is unable to properly
        extract ZIP archives due to technical limitations on your server. In
        this case, you can follow a manual installation procedure.</para>

        <para>First, you have to extract the installation ZIP file in a
        subdirectory named <filename>cmsupdate</filename> on your local PC.
        Then, upload the entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary
        directory. At this point, there should be a subdirectory named
        <filename>cmsupdate</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
        which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

        <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
        located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global
        Configuration</guimenuitem>, click on the <guilabel>Server</guilabel>
        tab and take a look at the <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel>
        setting. The default setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory
        under your site's root. Rarely, especially on automated installations
        using Fantastico, this might have been assigned the system-wide
        <filename>/tmp</filename> directory. In this case, please consult your
        host for instructions on how to upload files inside this directory, or
        about changing your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> temporary directory
        back to the default location and making it writable.</para>

        <para>Assuming that you are past this uploading step, click on the
        <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Extensions
        Manager</guimenuitem> link on the top menu. In this page, locate the
        <guibutton>Install Directory</guibutton> edit box in the
        <guilabel>Install from Directory</guilabel> area. It is already filled
        in with the absolute path to your temporary directory, for example
        <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp</filename>. Please append
        <filename>/cmsupdate</filename> to it. As per our example, it should
        look something like
        <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp/cmsupdate</filename>. Then, click on the
        <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.</para>

        <para>Updating <application>Akeeba CMS Update</application> to the
        latest version is by no means different than installing the component.
        You do not have to uninstall the previous version; in fact, you are
        discouraged from doing so. Simply follow the installation instructions
        so as to install the latest <application>Akeeba CMS

          <para>The top part consisting of the update notification pane, the

          versions.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Let's see what each area is supposed to do.</para>

      <bridgehead>The top area - Main update status and actions</bridgehead>

      <para>The top half of the page is dedicated to presenting the backup
      status and allowing you to perform updates.</para>

      <para>The first thing you see is the backup status pane. It's green when
      your site is up to date, red when an update is available. It informs you
      of the currently installed Joomla! version and the available updated
      version (if one is available).</para>

      <para>Right below it you can find the <guilabel>Update
      Options</guilabel> pane. In here you can define the following setting
      which are taken into account when updating your site:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><guilabel>Backup on update</guilabel>. Shown only when Akeeba
          Backup is installed. If set to <option>Yes</option>, a backup of
          your site will be taken right before installing the new Joomla!
          version on it. The backup profile used can be set up in the <link
          linkend="options-page">options page</link>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><guilabel>FTP User</guilabel> and <guilabel>FTP
          Password</guilabel>. On many hosts (notable: most shared hosting
          providers) trying to extract the backup directly will fail due to
          file ownership and permissions. In this case you just need to enable
          Joomla!'s FTP system through your site's <guilabel>Global
          Configuration</guilabel> page. Out of security reasons many users
          prefer not to enter their FTP username and password in that page.
          However these are required when performing the update. This is why
          you get the chance to enter them in Akeeba CMS Update before
          performing the update.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <important>
        <para>These options appear only when necessary. If no options are
        necessary on your site you will not see the <guilabel>Update
        Options</guilabel> pane at all.</para>
      </important>

      <para>You can hide this pane by clicking the <guibutton>Update
      options</guibutton> button below it.</para>

      <para>Right below you can find the update buttons, which can be one or
      more of the following:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><guibutton>Reinstall Joomla! x.y.z</guibutton>. If your
          installed Joomla! release is still available for download you will
          be given the option to reinstall it. This is useful when you suspect
          that some Joomla! files are corrupt, missing or tampered
          with.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><guibutton>Update to Joomla! x.y.z</guibutton>. If an update
          is available you are given the option to update to it; this is what
          this component is all about. By clicking on this button you will be
          begin the <link linkend="update-process">update
          process</link>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Finally, you can see the <guibutton>Reload update
      information</guibutton> button and the last update check time. You only
      need to click on the <guibutton>Reload update information</guibutton>
      button if you believe that the displayed update information is stuck /
      out of date. This is why you are presented with the last update check
      time. It tells you exactly when Akeeba CMS Update last checked for
      available Joomla! updates.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Let's make this clear. You DO NOT normally need to use the
        <guibutton>Reload update information</guibutton> button. Akeeba CMS
        Update will check for updates automatically. The frequency of these
        checks is defined in the <link linkend="options-page">Options
        page</link>. You only need to press this button if a new Joomla!
        version is out and you don't want to wait until the next scheduled
        update check.</para>
      </important>

      <important>
        <para>Akeeba CMS Update does not use the same update mechanism as
        Joomla! Update. One component might show an available update while the
        other doesn't. This doesn't mean that either component is broken. It
        only means that each component checked for updates <emphasis>at a
        different time</emphasis>, therefore seeing a different Joomla! update
        status, hence the disparity in the displayed results. Please do not
        file a bug report about this, it's not a bug, it's the very definition
        of how software updates work in every software, from Windows to Ubuntu
        Linux and from Joomla! to WordPress.</para>

          months. These have all the new and improved features but not all
          third party software is designed for them. Additionally, newer STS
          versions with an increased minor version number (the number after
          the first dot) might have subtle changes to their predecessors,
          potentially causing issues on update.</para>

          lifetime of 18 months. No new features are to be found there, only
          bug and security fixes. These are the recommended versions for most

          <para><emphasis role="bold">Testing</emphasis>. ATTENTION: THERE BE
          DRAGONS! These are alpha, beta and release candidates of the
          upcoming Joomla! version, whatever it is. You are only supposed to
          install them if you are a developer OR if you want to help with
          testing Joomla! (please do, we need more testers). You are advised
          to install these versions on test sites, not your production sites.
          Stability of these version is, by their very definition, NOT
          guaranteed. In fact the Joomla! developers bet that there is some
          instability, that's why they kindly request as many users as
          possible to test these releases and help improve Joomla!. The
          Joomla! developers cannot possibly test against all possible
          configurations. Fact: nobody claims to do that, not even
          multibillion corporations. For example Microsoft also relies on a
          similar crowdsourced beta testing for its new Windows releases. So,
          pretty please, if you have 10 minutes to spare every now and then
          consider installing these testing releases on a test site on your
          preferred hosting and report any bugs you find. Otherwise you can
          expect that these bugs will most likely go unnoticed, even if you

              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>Let's understand what current version branch means. Joomla!
            versions typically consist of three numbers separated by dots,
            e.g. 1.2.3. The first two numbers (called major and minor version
            respectively) define the current branch. So, any version beginning
            with 1.2 –e.g. 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.123– belongs to the "1.2
            branch". When Akeeba CMS Update considers the current branch it
            reads your currently installed version and uses its first two
            numbers to filter available updates. For example, if you had
            Joomla! 3.1.5 installed it will only show you an available update
            for Joomla! 3.1.6, but not an available update for Joomla! 3.2.0
            or later.</para>

            <para>Using the current branch is recommended if you are running
            an STS release and you have not yet tested if you can safely
            upgrade your site to the next STS or LTS version of
            Joomla!.</para>

    <title><acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License version 3</title>

    <para>Version 3, 29 June 2007</para>

    <para>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <link
    xlink:href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</link></para>

    <para>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="Preamble">Preamble</bridgehead>

    <para>The <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License is a free,
    copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.</para>

    <para>The licenses for most software and other practical works are
    designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By
    contrast, the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License is intended to
    guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to
    make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
    Software Foundation, use the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License
    for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this
    way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</para>

    <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
    the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
    you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
    you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and
    that you know you can do these things.</para>

    <para>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</para>

    <para>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
    that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
    the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.</para>

    <para>Developers that use the <acronym>GNU</acronym>
    <acronym>GPL</acronym> protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
    copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</para>

    <para>For the developers' and authors' protection, the
    <acronym>GPL</acronym> clearly explains that there is no warranty for this
    free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the
    <acronym>GPL</acronym> requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.</para>

    <para>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
    users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
    abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
    precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
    version of the <acronym>GPL</acronym> to prohibit the practice for those
    products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
    ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
    <acronym>GPL</acronym>, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</para>

    <para>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make
    it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the <acronym>GPL</acronym>
    assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</para>

    <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.</para>

    <bridgehead>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</bridgehead>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="Definitions">0.
    Definitions.</bridgehead>

    <para>“This License” refers to version 3 of the <acronym>GNU</acronym>
    General Public License.</para>

    <para>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
    of works, such as semiconductor masks.</para>

    <para>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients”
    may be individuals or organizations.</para>

    <para>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
    work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
    an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
    earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</para>

    <para>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.</para>

    <para>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
    under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
    modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with
    or without modification), making available to the public, and in some
    countries other activities as well.</para>

    <para>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
    computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</para>

    <para>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
    the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
    warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
    License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents
    a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in
    the list meets this criterion.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="SourceCode">1. Source
    Code.</bridgehead>

    <para>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of
    a work.</para>

    <para>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
    widely used among developers working in that language.</para>

    <para>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
    Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major
    Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
    window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
    which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or
    an object code interpreter used to run it.</para>

    <para>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
    run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control

    Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs

    <para>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
    household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
    product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical
    or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
    particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
    or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer
    product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
    industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
    significant mode of use of the product.</para>

    <para>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.</para>

    <para>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
    of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
    Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
    (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
    Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
    Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
    third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
    User Product (for example, the work has been installed in

    <para>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
    a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.</para>

    <para>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
    provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly

    <para>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
    treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
    they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only
    to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
    permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
    without regard to the additional permissions.</para>

    <para>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
    (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
    certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
    permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
    have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</para>

    <para>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
    you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
    of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</para>

      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
    restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
    you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
    restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
    may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
    document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
    relicensing or conveying.</para>

    <para>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
    terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
    applicable terms.</para>

    <para>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
    requirements apply either way.</para>

    Termination.</bridgehead>

    <para>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
    it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
    of section 11).</para>

    <para>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
    to 60 days after the cessation.</para>

    <para>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
    receipt of the notice.</para>

    <para>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="AcceptanceNotRequired">9. Acceptance
    Not Required for Having Copies.</bridgehead>

    <para>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
    receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
    other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
    covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
    indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="AutomaticDownstream">10. Automatic
    Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</bridgehead>

    <para>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
    enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</para>

    <para>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
    results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
    receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
    the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
    paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
    work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
    get it with reasonable efforts.</para>

    <para>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
    impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
    granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
    is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing
    the Program or any portion of it.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="Patents">11. Patents.</bridgehead>

    <para>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
    thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</para>

    <para>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by
    this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
    not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
    further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
    definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
    manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</para>

    <para>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
    use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
    the contents of its contributor version.</para>

    <para>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
    for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party
    means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
    against the party.</para>

    <para>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
    copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then
    you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or
    (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for
    this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
    requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
    recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
    for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
    your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one
    or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
    believe are valid.</para>

    <para>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving
    the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
    specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
    automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
    based on it.</para>

    <para>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
    the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
    granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a
    party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
    distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
    based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
    which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
    covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
    with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
    copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
    compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
    arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March
    2007.</para>

    <para>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
    be available to you under applicable patent law.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect1" xml:id="NoSurrender">12. No Surrender of
    Others' Freedom.</bridgehead>

    <para>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
    or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</para>

    version 3 of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Affero General Public License into
    a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
    this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,

    <para>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the
    <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License “or any later version”
    applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the
    Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
    of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License, you may choose any
    version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

    <para>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License can be used,
    that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
    authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</para>

    <para>Later license versions may give you additional or different

    to Your New Programs</bridgehead>

    <para>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.</para>

    <para>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</para>

    <simpara>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
    this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section0">0. PREAMBLE</bridgehead>

    <simpara>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
    other functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
    without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
    for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
    made by others.</simpara>

    <simpara>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</simpara>

    <simpara>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can
    be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it
    is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section1">1. APPLICABILITY AND
    DEFINITIONS</bridgehead>

    <simpara>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
    that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below, refers to any
    such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or
    distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
    law.</simpara>

    <simpara>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing
    the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</simpara>

    <simpara>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</simpara>

    <simpara>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
    does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
    be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
    Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
    there are none.</simpara>

    <simpara>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
    words.</simpara>

    <simpara>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
    not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
    not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.</simpara>

    <simpara>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.</simpara>

    <simpara>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
    material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the
    text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</simpara>

    <simpara>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes
    copies of the Document to the public.</simpara>

    <simpara>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
    whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
    following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
    for a specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
    “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title” of
    such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.</simpara>

    <simpara>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
    which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section2">2. VERBATIM
    COPYING</bridgehead>

    <simpara>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</simpara>

    <simpara>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
    and you may publicly display copies.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section3">3. COPYING IN
    QUANTITY</bridgehead>

    <simpara>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
    have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</simpara>

    <simpara>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</simpara>

    <simpara>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
    Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
    network-using public has access to download using public-standard network
    protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
    material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
    steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition
    to the public.</simpara>

    <simpara>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
    of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section4">4.
    MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

    <simpara>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
    under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</simpara>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
        distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
        versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
        section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
        version if the original publisher of that version gives
        permission.</simpara>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or

        Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors
        of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
        five), unless they release you from this requirement.</simpara>

        and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
        there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
        for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it
        was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section. You may
        omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
        years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
        version it refers to gives permission.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
        Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
        dedications given therein.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
        equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section
        may not be included in the Modified Version.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
        “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <simpara>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
    these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
    Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.</simpara>

    <simpara>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties — for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
    approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.</simpara>

    <simpara>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
    and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
    list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
    arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
    cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
    made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
    another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
    previous publisher that added the old one.</simpara>

    <simpara>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
    License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert
    or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section5">5. COMBINING
    DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

    <simpara>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
    this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
    them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
    notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>

    <simpara>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
    If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
    contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
    of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
    that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
    to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
    notice of the combined work.</simpara>

    <simpara>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
    “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
    “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and
    any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled
    “Endorsements”.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section6">6. COLLECTIONS OF
    DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

    <simpara>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
    documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
    of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
    included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
    License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
    respects.</simpara>

    <simpara>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
    distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy
    of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in
    all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section7">7. AGGREGATION WITH
    INDEPENDENT WORKS</bridgehead>

    <simpara>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
    the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
    Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
    other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
    the Document.</simpara>

    <simpara>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
    entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section8">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

    <simpara>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
    from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
    all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
    Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all
    the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
    provided that you also include the original English version of this
    License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
    case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of
    this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
    prevail.</simpara>

    <simpara>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
    “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
    Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
    title.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section9">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

    <simpara>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
    copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License.</simpara>

    <simpara>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
    to 60 days after the cessation.</simpara>

    <simpara>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
    receipt of the notice.</simpara>

    <simpara>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
    the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
    give you any rights to use it.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section10">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF
    THIS LICENSE</bridgehead>

    <simpara>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
    the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
    to address new problems or concerns. See <link
    xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">Copyleft</link>.</simpara>

    <simpara>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
    number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
    this License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
    can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy’s
    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
    choose that version for the Document.</simpara>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect2" xml:id="section11">11.
    RELICENSING</bridgehead>

    <simpara>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means
    any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public
    wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A “Massive
    Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set
    of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</simpara>

    <simpara>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
    license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published

    <simpara>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole
    or in part, as part of another Document.</simpara>

    <simpara>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
    License, and if all works that were first published under this License
    somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
    in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
    (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</simpara>

    <simpara>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
    site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</simpara>
