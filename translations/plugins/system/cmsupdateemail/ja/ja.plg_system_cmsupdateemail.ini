; PLG_CMSUPDATEEMAIL_EMAIL_BODY_WHOSENTIT="This email is sent to you by the [PLUGINNAME] plugin running on your site. This plugin, which is part of the Akeeba CMS Update component, periodically checks for new Joomla! versions and send an email to the site's Super Users when an updated Joomla! version is found. Neither Joomla! nor Akeeba Ltd know your email address or send you an email. If you do not wish to receive this email please disable the [PLUGINNAME] plugin by logging in to your site's administrator back-end and then going to Extensions, Plugin Manager. Find the [PLUGINNAME] plugin and disable it."

If you are not sure if this email message is legitimate, please visit your site's administrator back-end, go to Components, Akeeba CMS Update and check if this new Joomla! version is listed there."
; PLG_CMSUPDATEEMAIL_EMAIL_BODY_WHATISTHISLINK="Following the link above will try to log you in to your site and open Akeeba CMS Update where you can complete the update. This might not work on some sites, for example if you have a security extension installed or when you are using Two Factor Authentication. In those case you can still upgrade your site by logging in to your site's administrator back-end, then go to Components, Akeeba CMS Update and update Joomla! from that page. The link above is valid only for 24 hours or until its first use, whichever comes first. If you have multiple Super Users on your site, when one of them clicks on their link, your link will automatically be deactivated."
